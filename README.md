# My Snake Game - In Python
For my computer science final project I chose to recreate the game Snake. In this game, the snake eats the food and grows as it eats, aswell the sanke has to avoid hitting the barriar and itself so it does not die and thus end the game. This game also includes things like speed levels, in game score and highscore tracking, random spawn, and arrow key conrol with space bar pause feature.
# How to run the game
Start by running the code, once the blue screen pops up choose a level based of what speed difficulty you want to use. Once the level is selected, press any arrow key to start the game, then using the arrow keys to move, try to eat the food and play until you die. At any point yu can pause, and once you die you can choose to try again with the same level or go and choose a new speed level.
# Required libraries to instal
This uses pyton libraries, which do not require instalation. For extrenal libraries Tkinter and os were importated to create the game messages, peramiters, and files storage for highscores.
